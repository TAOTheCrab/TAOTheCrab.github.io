I've been mulling over possible posts for this blog.
I have a few ideas I need to flesh out, but I was also thinking about doing some kind of series to build some creative momentum and practice.

I've been following a blog that does a weekly digest of what they've done.
Mostly short summaries, sometimes a couple of thoughts, and it does keep their blog going.

So I was thinking of doing something similar. Probably leaning more on the thoughts side as things get going.

The biggest problem I can see is that, in terms of things I could consistently write about,
I mostly tinker with maintenance-level tasks (like my last post) and play video games.

I could certainly use more records of what I've done while tinkering,
so making that a habit for this blog would be good.
I might need to think of some overarching goal(s) to be working on for that
to make it better than just merging/linking web search results,
which will probably make it a bit more story-like.
I'm not sure, it's probably something I should just try and see, maybe with prepared delete key.
I have one or two ideas related to CrabBot, but one involves remembering setup steps, so not great...

But the video games side...

Writing about video games is a little harder of an idea that I still sorta want to do.
I've wanted to engage with games in a more critical form,
I guess mostly to get into (or at least think about) deeper discussions than just
responding to claims of things being garbage.
Again, I'm not sure, I guess I'm not satisfied with being this surface-level with a hobby I spend so much time on.

My issues with it are that I'm not sure I can find a meaningful angle to discuss from (meh, not the worst problem),
and that... I guess I don't want to risk having to moderate responses to gaming opinions.
Considering I just, while writing this, found it hard to articulate that anxiety,
I suppose it wasn't that serious, just a reaction to watching the last few years of
discussion around games writing and related comment sections.

I don't know, I don't feel like I have a strong idea for games writing, or particularly strong opinions
beyond wanting to maybe start more positive discussions about game design as a player.
Then again, most of the people I talk to quickly descend into "this is 'objectively' garbage"
territory for small problems or patch changes even if they're only bad in theory,
and I have had overreactive moderating responses to such (frankly obvious) hyperbole,
so maybe I can't really even approach this idea with a healthy mindset.

I dunno. I want to do something with games, and not entirely on the creation side,
but it may work out better overall if I only did, say, a game dev log.
I suppose it would intersect better with the rest of the blog's implied tech focus.
I'd just have to start making games, heh...

So that's some of what I've been thinking about for this blog. I haven't quite forgotten about it.

For now, you can find me on my Twitter if you have any comments, though I may not be as responsive as you might expect from Twitter.
