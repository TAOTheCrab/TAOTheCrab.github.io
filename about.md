My name is Jeffrey, and I'm a former computer science student and frequent video game player.
Sometimes I do random projects, but usually I'm basically tinkering with system-admin-type stuff.

"The Crab" was a character from a comic I drew a long time ago.

This blog uses the default Jekyll theme (for now. Expect horrible untrained design testing in the future.)
